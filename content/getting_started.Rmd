# Getting Started with R at Reed

R is a versatile tool, and at Reed R is used across departments and in various ways. Our goal is to help you navigate this tool in any setting that you might use it. This document will be an introduction to the Reed RStudio Server, Desktop R, and the R thesis template. 

### Reed RStudio Server

_hello_

### Desktop R

_hello_

### Writing Your Thesis in `thesisdown`

The `thesisdown` package provides an R Markdown template for writing your senior thesis, which is particularly helpful for easily integrating R code and graphics into your thesis manuscript. Instructions for how to install this package and use the template can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown).

### The `palmerpenguins` Data

The `palmerpenguins` data set contains various different size measurements for three penguins species on three islands in Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. It's versatile and a great data set for demonstrating basic things that you can do in R. More information on the data set can be found [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html).
