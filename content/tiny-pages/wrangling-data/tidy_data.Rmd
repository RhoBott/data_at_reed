### Tidy data principles, reshaping data, and `tidyr`

Packages in the `tidyverse`, like `ggplot2` (useful for visualizing data) and `dplyr` (a key tool in data wrangling), are built to work with so-called "tidy" data. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "tidy-images/small_tidydata_1.jpg")
```

One of the core arguments for tidy data is often summarized with an adaptation of the famous Leo Tolstoy quote "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "tidy-images/small_tidydata_2.jpg")
```

With a consistent set of rules for formatting data, the ideas and tools used to conduct one data analysis can be more easily transferred to another.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "tidy-images/small_tidydata_3.jpg")
```

The `tidyr` package will prove useful in data restructuring or "tidying". All of the packages in the `tidyverse`, including `ggplot2` and `dplyr`, as well as many community-contributed packages, are designed to work  with data in tidy format.

You can see what tidy and untidy data look might look like in practice in the [Tidy example](INTERNAL-LINK) section, and learn how to turn untidy data into tidy data in the [Restructuring with `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()`](INTERNAL-LINK) section.
