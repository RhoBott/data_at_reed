# More Resources

Hopefully, now that you've read through the documentation here, it's answered some (if not all) of your questions. But there are always more resources out there!



### R package cheatsheets

RStudio has collected many cheatsheets for common R packages, and they can be found [here](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). Some possibly helpful ones to check out include sheets for data visualization with `ggplot2`, data transformation with `dplyr`, data import with `readr`, and R Markdown.

### mLab help

You can come and get help from someone at the [mLab](https://www.reed.edu/cis/mlab/index.html), and drop-in help hours can be found [on our calendar](https://www.reed.edu/cis/mlab/calendar.html).
