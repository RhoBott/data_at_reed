# More Resources

Hopefully, you've read through the documentation here, and it's answered some of your questions. But there are always more resources out there.


### R package cheatsheets

RStudio has collected many cheatsheets for common R packages, and they can be found [here](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). Some possibly helpful ones to check out include sheets for data visualization with `ggplot2`, data transformation with `dplyr`, data import with `readr`, and R Markdown.

### mLab

You can come and get help from someone at the [mLab](https://www.reed.edu/cis/mlab/index.html), and drop-in help hours can be found [here](https://www.reed.edu/cis/mlab/calendar.html).
