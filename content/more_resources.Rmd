# More Resources

Hopefully, now that you've read through the documentation here, it's answered some (if not all) of your questions. But there are always more resources out there.

### R package Cheatsheets and Documentation

RStudio has collected many cheatsheets for common R packages, and they can be found [here](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). Some possibly helpful ones to check out include sheets for data visualization with `ggplot2`, data transformation with `dplyr`, data import with `readr`, and R Markdown.

There are also specific websites for many of the packages shown on this site, with more examples and possible uses. Here are links to the websites for [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/), [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/), [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/), [googlesheets4](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/), and [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/). For any package you are working with, there should be documentation online to help you figure out how to use it.

### mLab Help

You can come and get help from someone at the [mLab](https://www.reed.edu/cis/mlab/index.html), and drop-in help hours can be found [on our calendar](https://www.reed.edu/cis/mlab/calendar.html).

### Free Online Textbook

One great resource for R is the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) textbook. It's free and made to be easy to navigate online. There are chapters on [data visualization](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html), [tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html), [data transformation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html), [strings](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html), and more. We highly recommend this resource.

### Googling

Sometimes, if you get a strange error or have a very specific question about a particular function, other people may have had that question before as well. If you want to google an error or how to do a particular operation in R, we would suggest that you include the name of the package that you are using when you search for help. For anything you want to do, there are going to be many, many ways of doing it in R. But most likely, you are going to want to do those things using packages you already know and love, like `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, or `tidyr`. 

### Asking for Help

#### Stack Overflow

Another good resource for getting help is [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). When googling a problem, you will likely find a lot of results that link to a stack overflow page. This is a great way to read into how other people solved a problem similar to yours. You can also ask questions on stack overflow, but there's no guarantee that someone will respond to you and even if someone does respond it might not be immediate.

#### Reproducible Examples

A great way to streamline the process of getting help is to create what is called a reproducible example or "reprex". There are a couple of key steps to creating a reprex:

1. Include any package loading calls (library("package")) and objects that are relevant to your problem.

2. Only include whatever is relevant or necessary to your problem. In reprex jargon, this is called making your example minimal.

By following this convention you'll make it a lot easier for someone to understand and help with your issue. For more on reproducible examples, check out [this](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) tidyverse page.
