```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(knitr)
```

this is a place for the _old_ documentation to live! the folders in this folder
are analogous to the old headings on the 
[R tutorial page](https://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed/resources/R/index.html). 
each of those headings will be a single page in the new tutorials. :-)
