# Statistical software packages

In addition to R, there are other statistical software programs in use today such as Stata, SPSS, and SAS. Files from these programs can be read in using the haven package.

#### Reading R data files

You can save an R object directly as a `.Rda` or `.RData` file. These can be loaded back into a new environment with the command `load('folder/data.Rda')`.

#### Stata

`haven::read_dta('file.dta')`

####SPSS

`haven::read_sav('file.sav')`, or `haven::read_por('file.por') for an older file type`
