the old docs
================

this is a place for the *old* documentation to live\! the folders in
this folder are analogous to the old headings on the [R tutorial
page](https://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed/resources/R/index.html). each of
those headings will be a single page in the new tutorials. :-)

#### importing the old stuff (hi leila)

i think we just need to import the stuff that doesnâ€™t have the explicit
html extension? still trying to find a good workflow.
