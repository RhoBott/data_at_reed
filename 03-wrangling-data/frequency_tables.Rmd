#### Frequency tables with `count()`

Frequency tables provide one way of displaying information about your data. 

For example, how many male and female penguins are in the sample?

First, use function `count()` by the variable of interest (`sex`):

```{r}
penguins %>%
  count(sex)
```

The penguins dataset includes 165 females, 168 males, and 11 individual birds for which sex is unknown.

To divide these counts by island (as well as sex), `count()` by `island` and `sex`:

```{r}
penguins %>%
  count(island, sex)
```

`count()` is a quick and easy way to produce frequency tables in R.
