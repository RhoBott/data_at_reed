#### Arranging rows with `arrange()`

Sometimes it is helpful to sort data, alphabetically or numerically. You can sort data using the `arrange()` function from `dplyr`.

To arrange all penguins, in order of increasing bill length:

```{r}
penguins %>%
  arrange(bill_length_mm)
```

In order or decreasing bill length:

```{r}
penguins %>%
  arrange(desc(bill_length_mm))
```

For text data, `dplyr` will arrange alphabetically.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  arrange(species)
```
