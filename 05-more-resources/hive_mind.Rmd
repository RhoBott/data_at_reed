### Hive mind: forums and asking questions

Often, you will not be the first person to encounter an error or to have a particular question. (Some examples: "How do I remove `NA`s from my data?" "How do I make R understand this date information?" "How do I combine a boxplot and a scatterplot so I can show multiple aspects of the data?")

#### Finding answers in forums

When searching for answers to your code-related questions, include the name of the package that you are using and a few words about what you are trying to do (or the error text). If the code in your search results doesn't make sense to you, do not despair - there are many ways of accomplishing the same task in R. 

Two good places to look for already-answered questions are the [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). Reading forum posts can be useful because you can see how other people have solved a similar problem.

#### One-on-one assistance from Reedies

Often, it can be helpful to work through problems with another person in real time. For work related to Reed classes, theses, and student/faculty research, you can get help from someone at the [mLab](https://www.reed.edu/cis/mlab/index.html), and drop-in help hours can be found [on our calendar](https://www.reed.edu/cis/mlab/calendar.html). 

For all data questions, coding and otherwise, you can reach out to the Data@Reed team by emailing data@reed.edu .

#### Asking for help

When asking for help, the first step is creating a "reprex", short for *repr*oducible *ex*ample. Reproducible examples help others help you by ensuring that they can replicate the problem that you're experiencing in order to troubleshoot more easily. There are a couple of key steps to creating a reprex:

1. Include any package loading calls (`library(package)`) and objects (i.e. datasets) that are relevant to your problem.

2. Only include whatever is relevant or necessary to your problem. In reprex jargon, this is called making your example "minimal".

By taking the time to create a reprex, you are asking a more understandable question - meaning that you are much more likely to get a useful answer. For more on reproducible examples and asking questions, check out [the tidyverse "Get help!" ](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) page.

Once you have prepared a reprex, two possible courses of action:

  - If you are a Reedie, the mLabbies and/or the Data@Reed team will be thrilled to see that you have prepared a reprex and will be glad to help.
  - Pose your question on an online forum; as mentioned above, two good places to start are the [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com) and  [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).
