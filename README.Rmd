yall! !!!

this is a GitHub repository that will help us manage an update to the [Data at Reed](data-at-reed) site. specifically, the information at [Analyzing & Visualizing Data > R tutorials]!

ideally, we can point people who come into the mLab to that site to help address common issues. unfortunately, Nothing Has Happened to those pages for a good bit of time and, as a result, they donâ€™t reflect the kinds of issues we see most often now.

so uhhh they need updating! sweet.

## what now?

Leila and I have added all of the previous files in the `old_docs` folder, and an outline of what the new content could look like below.

(hehe we haven't yet though.. on it!?)


## a new outline

from our collab doc, Leila!

## keeping-in-mind-things

(i.e. not using iris, linking out, etc)
